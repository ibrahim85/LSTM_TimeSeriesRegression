# LSTM_TimeSeriesRegression
Fall 2016 FRI Project for CS 378: Computational Intelligence in Design II at UT Austin.

My goal that semester was to create a tool for the game League of Legends that could predict the winner of "laning phase" before the game started. To do this I had to divide the project into two parts:


## Midterm
Implement a basic Time Series Regression that works for sinusoidal functions using Multi-layer perceptrons and LSTMs.

## Final
Run a similar model using time series data from League of Legends.
