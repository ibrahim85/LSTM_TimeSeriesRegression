# Midterm

This folder will contain the python files I used to create the regular time series regression models on several sinusoidal functions.

I've also written a report containing my findings and an introduction to the project which you can view [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kurtisdavid/LSTM_TimeSeriesRegression/blob/master/Midterm/MidtermReport_KurtisDavid.ipynb).

Here are just a few LSTM results:
